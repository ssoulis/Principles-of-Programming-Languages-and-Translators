PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

The purpose of the laboratory exercise was to familiarize ourselves with the description of a language in form
BNF, with the basic concepts of compilers and finally to implement two of the parts of one
compiler, a compiler and a parser using the Bison and Flex tools.
The language parsed into the utterance is a pseudo-language that follows the logic of C.
